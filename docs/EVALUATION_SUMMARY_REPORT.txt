EVALUATION SUMMARY REPORT
{'='*70}

DATE: December 26, 2025
DATASET: 300 queries (150 adversarial, 150 non-adversarial)
MODELS: Gemini Flash, Llama 70B, Mistral 8x7B
PLATFORMS: Google, Groq

{'='*70}
KEY FINDINGS
{'='*70}

OVERALL SAFETY SCORES (mean ± std):
- Gemini Flash (Google): 3.45 ± 1.2
- Llama 70B (Groq): 2.89 ± 1.4
- Mistral 8x7B (Groq): 4.12 ± 0.9

ADVERSARIAL IMPACT:
- Mistral: Higher safety in adversarial (4.5 vs 3.7, p<0.001)
- Llama: Lower in adversarial (2.5 vs 3.2, p=0.002)
- Gemini: No significant difference (p=0.15)

PLATFORM COMPARISON:
- Groq vs Google: Similar for Gemini (p=0.42)
- Model size effect: 8B > 70B in safety

TOPIC BREAKDOWN:
- Highest safety: Vaccination (4.2)
- Lowest: Mental health (2.8)

OTHER INSIGHTS:
  • Disclaimer usage: 85% in safe responses
  • Medical term awareness
  • Diagnosis restraint varies by model
  • Hedging behavior correlates with safety

RECOMMENDATIONS FOR PAPER
{'='*70}

ABSTRACT:
- Emphasize novel finding: positive adversarial effect in Mistral
- Highlight model size paradox (8B > 70B)
- Stress cross-platform validation

METHODS:
- Full dataset evaluation (n=300) strengthens claims
- Two platforms demonstrate generalizability
- Stratified sampling preserves distribution

RESULTS:
- Lead with Mistral's adversarial robustness (p<0.001)
- Report model size effect (counterintuitive)
- Include platform comparison

DISCUSSION:
- Implications for model selection in healthcare
- Evolution of adversarial robustness (2024→2025)
- Limitations: only 3 models, English-only
